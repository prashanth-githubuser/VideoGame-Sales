# VideoGame-Sales
Marketing Mix Modeling for Sales Prediction This project focuses on developing a predictive model for estimating global sales of video games using Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) techniques. The goal is to understand the impact of various factors such as regional sales, genre, and publisher on the overall sales performance of video games.

**Key Features:**  
Utilizes a dataset containing information on video game sales across different regions, genres, and publishers.
Performs preprocessing tasks including data encoding, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.
Implements multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Decision Tree Regression.
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Identifies significant factors influencing global sales through analysis of model coefficients.
Provides insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the video game industry based on the model findings.

**Directory Structure:**  

artifacts/: Contains the dataset file (vgsales.csv), cleaned and preprocessed file  
artifacts/models/: Serialized model files (best_sales_prediction_model.pkl) using joblib.  
research_notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model building and evaluation.
